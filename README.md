# Embodied Aesthetic Reconstruction  
*Final MSc Project — University of the Arts London (CCI)*  

## 🌐 Overview  
This project, **Embodied Aesthetic Reconstruction**, explores how **motion capture** and **generative AI** can be used to resist disciplinary norms of body aesthetics.  
Instead of enforcing an “ideal body” shaped by algorithms, the system generates **playful, personalised artistic representations** that celebrate diverse embodiment.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Motion Capture Input** → extract pose landmarks (via MediaPipe).  
- **Cross-modal Embeddings** → fuse pose with personality traits (Big Five sliders).  
- **Generative Output**:  
  - *Visual*: Stylised image output (Diffusion/Dreambooth can be integrated).  
  - *Audio*: Soundscape generation (RAVE/AudioLM integration planned).  
- **Ethics by Design**: consent gate, data retention toggle, bias awareness.  

## 🚀 Installation  
Clone the repository and set up environment:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vanillasky78/EmbodiedAestheticReconstruction.git
cd EmbodiedAestheticReconstruction
conda create -n ear-mvp python=3.10 -y
conda activate ear-mvp
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py

# Embodied Aesthetic Reconstruction (macOS M4 Pro Setup)

An interactive AI system that matches human body poses to curated portrait artworks via **CLIP + Pose + Color fusion**.  
This guide explains how to install and run the project smoothly on Apple Silicon (M-series) macOS.

---

## 🧩 1. Environment Setup (Miniforge + Conda + MPS)

> Tested on macOS Sequoia 15.7 / Apple M4 Pro / Python 3.10 + PyTorch 2.2 MPS

### 1.1 Install Miniforge (or Miniconda for Apple Silicon)
Download and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh)"

Restart your terminal after installation.
1.2 Create and activate environment
Inside your project folder:
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/EmbodiedAestheticReconstruction
conda create -n ear-mvp python=3.10 -y
conda activate ear-mvp
1.3 Install dependencies
Use either the YAML file or the requirements.txt:
conda env update -f environment.yml
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
Confirm installation and device support:
python -m torch.utils.collect_env
You should see MPS available: True.

🚀 2. Run the App
conda activate ear-mvp
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/EmbodiedAestheticReconstruction
streamlit run app.py
Then open the auto-generated local URL, usually:
http://localhost:8501
You’ll see:
Left sidebar: weight sliders, filters, and device status
Main area: camera capture or image upload interface
Results: Top-K portrait matches with metadata and scores
🖼️ 3. Dataset Preparation
Your project expects:
data/
├── images/                  ← portrait images (.jpg or .png)
├── interim/                 ← camera captures (autogenerated)
├── portrait_works.csv       ← metadata (title / artist / year / license)
⚠️ Important for iCloud Users
If your data/images folder is synced via iCloud, some files may appear as:
DaVinci_Ginevra.jpg.icloud
Those are not downloaded yet.
In Finder:
right-click data/images → Download Now
All images must be fully local before running the app.
🧠 4. Main Features
CLIP image embeddings ( open_clip_torch ViT-B-32 )
YOLOv8n-Pose via ultralytics (works on MPS)
Color histogram features (HSV fusion)
Adjustable weights for CLIP / Pose / Color
Public-Domain filter (based on license field in CSV)
Automatic embedding cache in .clip_cache/
⚙️ 5. Troubleshooting Guide
❌ “Invalid CUDA device '0'”
Apple Silicon does not support CUDA.
Fixed in this version (yolo_device() maps to MPS).
If you still see it, re-run after saving app.py.
❌ “Search failed: Error opening data/images”
The folder exists but contains .icloud files.
Right-click → Download Now, then reload Streamlit.
❌ “No pose feature detected”
Pose estimation runs best in well-lit images with visible upper body.
Try raising the Pose weight slider to 0.3 and Color weight to 0.2.
📸 Camera Access
If Streamlit cannot access your camera:
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → allow Terminal.app
📦 6. Development Tips
Task	Command
Update env	conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
Clear cache	rm -rf .clip_cache
Rebuild embeddings	Delete .clip_cache → restart app
Export requirements	pip freeze > requirements.txt
